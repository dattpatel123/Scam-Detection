During this AI4All accelerator project, we tackled the problem of scam and smishing text messages. By utilizing Python, random forest model, and streamlit we developed a program that helps identify if a text message is a scam of not. 



## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->


Scams are increasing and becoming harder to spot, especially with advances in AI-generated messages. So to tackle this problem, we wanted to explore how machine learning can be trained to recognize these messages and help flag them before people interact with them.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->



1. *Achieved 95.8% accuracy in scam message detection accuracy*
2. *Trained various models to achieve best performance: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression*
3. *Deployed to a website to allow users to easily paste their message and detect the scam*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

*To accomplish this, we utilized pandas, scikit learn, TF-IDF vectorizer to preprocess and train various machine learning models such as random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression.*
*Trained the models on 5000+ text messages labeled either as scam (promotion messages), smishing (dangerous fraud), or ham (safe).*
